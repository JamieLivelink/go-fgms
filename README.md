go-fgms
=======
FlightGearMultiPlayerServer = fgms

A serious attempt at rewriting the **fgms** in golang 
- in go lang, for fun!
- pilot connects and incoming on an fgms udp server
 - lots of udp packets at high +25hz
 - relay udp packets to other fgms server
 - send positions from other machines to pilot
 
But missing...
 - ability to get json data of current flights
 - have to hack a perl script to get mp data
 
 New FGMS
 =============================
 - rewrite in golang, which is close anough to c for now
 - use golang to provide various concurrent services
 -- connect + relay UDP packets
 -- telnet port for legacy
 -- xml feed/port for fgmap backward compat
 -- json port for fun
 -- websocket for for realtime
 -- spatially aware if required..
 
 New gen fgms that is rapidly upgradable and golang hackers can hack
 and improve big time.. without fear of crashing the whole system

FGMS
=======================================================
Is a relay packet server for FlightGear Sim
Its a port from Olivers, 
	code is cut and paste, 
	then c to go translate
	and its quite a bit different.
	code is libeerally all over the place in port
	
Currently  and tested using a localhost:
	
	- loads a basic configuration from json 
		json is preffered for now as it type casts 
		eg conf.Server.TelnetPort << yes and int
		
		
	- Relays and Blacklists are added, not via an entry but via
	  a dns lookup, so address needs to exists
	
	- a telnet port listneing and reposnding on 5001

	- and udp port listening on 5000

	- xdr decode the MsgHeader

Setting up channels to send udp..
remove all classes and into simpler code..
make each module "importable" and independant..

dream on ;-)

== Questions ===

Re TIME
Do we save time as uint64 with time.UTC().Unix()  == epoch_int ?
Means is can be 0 ? or can we use time.Time and make it nil ?
