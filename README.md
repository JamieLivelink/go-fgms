FGMS
=======================================================
Is a relay packet server for FlightGear Sim
Its a port from Olivers, 
	code is cut and paste, 
	then c to go translate
	and its quite a bit different.
	code is libeerally all over the place in port
	
Currently  and tested using a localhost:
	
	- loads a basic configuration from json 
		json is preffered for now as it type casts 
		eg conf.Server.TelnetPort << yes and int
		
		
	- Relays and Blacklists are added, not via an entry but via
	  a dns lookup, so address needs to exists
	
	- a telnet port listneing and reposnding on 5001

	- and udp port listening on 5000

	- xdr decode the MsgHeader

== Questions ===

Re TIME
Do we save time as uint64 with time.UTC().Unix()  == epoch_int ?
Means is can be 0 ? or can we use time.Time and make it nil ?
